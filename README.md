# How to Determine if the Output is Correct:
**Comparing R² scores:**

- A higher R² score means better predictive accuracy. If a model’s R² score is 
significantly higher than others, it is performing better.

**Evaluating RMSE, MSE, MAE:**

- Check which model has the lowest error values (RMSE, MSE, and MAE). Models with lower values for these metrics are making more accurate predictions.
- For example, a model with an RMSE of 1.24 is performing better than one with an RMSE of 1.76, so the first model is preferable.

**Explained Variance:**

- This should also be high for better models. If your model's explained variance is around 0.8 or higher, it is explaining a good portion of the target's variance.

**Conclusion:**
- The output is correct if you see reasonable values for these metrics, and if the models are performing similarly or better than simpler models (e.g., a random guess or the mean of the target variable).
- If your R² score is very low or negative, or if your error metrics (RMSE, MSE, MAE) are unusually high, the model is not performing well.
